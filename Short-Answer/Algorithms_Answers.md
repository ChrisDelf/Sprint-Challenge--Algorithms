#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n), if n is one it will only run through once. Even though it looks like a n^3.
    a = 0 + 1 + 1
    while 1 < 1* 1 * 1 it will stop


b) 0(n^2), A loop that is running a nested loop makes this O(n^2)


c)0(n) This function is simular to a loop. So its going to call its self unitl n is zero. It does n't have a catch if
the n is lower than zero so it could run to infinity and beyond

## Exercise II

N= height of the building
f= the height in which the egg breaks.

Create a order list of floors. First we will go to the middle floor a drop an egg. If the egg doesn't break it is the
minium height. If it does break drop the eggs form the other remaining floors until it doesn't break.
